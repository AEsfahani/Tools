&nbsp;

Have you missed having the validate key button in Vantive.
&nbsp;
<p>
No worries now you can validate Sage 100 Keys with Sage 100 Key Validation program, this application uses the same method as a Real MAS90 installation does to validate the keys and presents a list of all the modules that are on that key plus the number of user licenses that in the key.
